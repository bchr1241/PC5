47148,Chile,"The price on this wine is laughable, but the quality is excellent. Earthy aromas of lead pencil, baked plum, cassis and black cherry include chocolate and minerality. The palate is rich, jammy and a touch stewy, with herbal blackberry, cassis, chocoalte and coffee flavors. Even more chocolate and licorice rise up on the long finish.

43413,Chile,"Warm, furry aromas of olive, prune and animal hide are challenging. In the mouth, this cool-year Carmenère feels tartaric and narrow, with grating tannins.

55217,Chile,"Saucy, spicy aromas of wild berry, baked plum and raw oak are forceful and hard-driving. Wide, round, chewy and resiny in feel, this tastes lightly toasted, buttery and woody, but patience reveals deep berry fruit flavors and spice notes.

61144,Argentina,"This immense Cabernet contains 3% Malbec, and it's about as ripe and raisiny as a wine can get while still holding onto a semblance of balance. Aromas of raisin and baked blackberry blend with rooty cola and vanilla notes. This feels heavy to the point of syrupy, while flavors of prune, mocha and blueberry finish chunky, with low acidity.

Right now, the wine smells young and a bit closed, hiding some of its beauty and nuance behind the upfront black plum, cassis and cherry fruit aromas.

50702,Israel,"Inky ruby in the glass, this Bordeaux-style blend has aromas of caramel and anise that all but hide a whiff of cherry. On the tastebuds black cherry is the predominant flavor, backed by a mouth-pleasing chorus of allspice, violet, custard and mint.

22117,Israel,"This classic Bordeaux-style blend—made with 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot—is a stunner now, and it shows the potential to age for another 5–10 years. Black cherry, cassis and wild blackberry notes dominate the nose and mouth, but supporting accents of forest and cigar box spice add depth and interest to the fruit core.

23364,Israel,"Like the Petit Castel, this wine needs some time to truly open up and express itself, so be sure to give it time to breathe before serving. Medium weight but full in the mouth with firm tannins and a tight structure, the core of black fruit flavors are augmented by hints of tobacco, licorice root and woody spice.

345,Australia,"This wine contains some material over 100 years old, but shows no signs of fragility. Instead, it's concentrated through age and should hold in the bottle indefinitely.
